## Instructions

* Put your name at the top of the document. 

* **For ALL graphs, you should include appropriate labels.** 

* Feel free to change the default theme, which I currently have set to `theme_minimal()`. 

* Use good coding practice. Read the short sections on good code with [pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) and [ggplot2](https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html). **This is part of your grade!**

* When you are finished with ALL the exercises, uncomment the options at the top so your document looks nicer. Don't do it before then, or else you might miss some important warnings and messages.


## Warm-up exercises with garden data

These exercises will reiterate what you learned in the "Expanding the data wrangling toolkit" tutorial. If you haven't gone through the tutorial yet, you should do that first.

  1. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest weight in pounds for each vegetable and day of week. Display the results so that the vegetables are rows but the days of the week are columns.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(day = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, day) %>% 
  mutate(wt_lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>%
  summarize(daily_wt_lbs = sum(wt_lbs)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = day,
              values_from = daily_wt_lbs)
```

  2. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest in pound for each vegetable variety and then try adding the `plot` variable from the `plant_date_loc` table. This will not turn out perfectly. What is the problem? How might you fix it?

```{r}
summarized_garden_harvest <- garden_harvest%>%
  group_by(variety, date) %>%
  mutate(wt_lbs = weight*0.00220462) %>%
  summarize(daily_wt_lbs = sum(wt_lbs))

summarized_garden_harvest %>%
  left_join(plant_date_loc,
            by = "variety")

```

  3. I would like to understand how much money I "saved" by gardening, for each vegetable type. Describe how I could use the `garden_harvest` and `supply_cost` datasets, along with data from somewhere like [this](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/search?sort=relevance&store=10542) to answer this question. You can answer this in words, referencing various join functions. You don't need R code but could provide some if it's helpful.
  


  4. Subset the data to tomatoes. Reorder the tomato varieties from smallest to largest first harvest date. Create a barplot of total harvest in pounds for each variety, in the new order.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  filter(vegetable %in% c("tomatoes")) %>%
  mutate(variety2 = fct_reorder(variety, date,  .desc = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(variety2) %>% 
  summarize(tot_harvest_lbs = 
              sum(weight*0.00220462), 
            first_day_harvest = min(date)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tot_harvest_lbs, y = variety2)) +
  geom_col()
   
```

  5. In the `garden_harvest` data, create two new variables: one that makes the varieties lowercase and another that finds the length of the variety name. Arrange the data by vegetable and length of variety name (smallest to largest), with one row for each vegetable variety. HINT: use `str_to_lower()`, `str_length()`, and `distinct()`.
  
```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(variety_length = str_length(variety)) %>%
  mutate(variety_lower = str_to_lower(variety)) %>%
  arrange(vegetable, variety_length) %>%
  distinct(variety, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

  6. In the `garden_harvest` data, find all distinct vegetable varieties that have "er" or "ar" in their name. HINT: `str_detect()` with an "or" statement (use the | for "or") and `distinct()`.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(variety_er_ar = str_detect(variety, "er|ar")) %>%
  distinct(variety, variety_er_ar = TRUE)
```


## Bicycle-Use Patterns

In this activity, you'll examine some factors that may influence the use of bicycles in a bike-renting program.  The data come from Washington, DC and cover the last quarter of 2014.

<center>

![A typical Capital Bikeshare station. This one is at Florida and California, next to Pleasant Pops.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_station.jpg){300px}


![One of the vans used to redistribute bicycles to different stations.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_van.jpg){300px}

</center>

Two data tables are available:

- `Trips` contains records of individual rentals
- `Stations` gives the locations of the bike rental stations

Here is the code to read in the data. We do this a little differently than usualy, which is why it is included here rather than at the top of this file. To avoid repeatedly re-reading the files, start the data import chunk with `{r cache = TRUE}` rather than the usual `{r}`.

```{r cache=TRUE}
data_site <- 
  "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data.rds" 
Trips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))
Stations<-read_csv("http://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/DC-Stations.csv")
```

**NOTE:** The `Trips` data table is a random subset of 10,000 trips from the full quarterly data. Start with this small data table to develop your analysis commands. **When you have this working well, you should access the full data set of more than 600,000 events by removing `-Small` from the name of the `data_site`.**

### Temporal patterns

It's natural to expect that bikes are rented more at some times of day, some days of the week, some months of the year than others. The variable `sdate` gives the time (including the date) that the rental started. Make the following plots and interpret them:

  7. A density plot, which is a smoothed out histogram, of the events versus `sdate`. Use `geom_density()`.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sdate)) +
  geom_density()
```
  
  8. A density plot of the events versus time of day.  You can use `mutate()` with `lubridate`'s  `hour()` and `minute()` functions to extract the hour of the day and minute within the hour from `sdate`. Hint: A minute is 1/60 of an hour, so create a variable where 3:30 is 3.5 and 3:45 is 3.75.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = round(hour(sdate) + minute(sdate)/60.0, digits = 1)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day)) +
  geom_density()

```
  
  9. A bar graph of the events versus day of the week. Put day on the y-axis.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = day)) +
  geom_bar()
  
```
  
  10. Facet your graph from exercise 8. by day of the week. Is there a pattern?
  
Yes, there are less trips being made during the middle of the day from Mon-Fri, while the opposite appears to be true on Sat & Sun. This can likely be explained by people using bikes to get to and from work during the week, and for more lesiurly rides during the weekend.
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = round(hour(sdate) + minute(sdate)/60.0, digits = 1)) %>%
  mutate(day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day)) +
  geom_density()+
  facet_wrap(vars(day))
```
  
The variable `client` describes whether the renter is a regular user (level `Registered`) or has not joined the bike-rental organization (`Causal`). The next set of exercises investigate whether these two different categories of users show different rental behavior and how `client` interacts with the patterns you found in the previous exercises. Repeat the graphic from Exercise \@ref(exr:exr-temp) (d) with the following changes:

  11. Change the graph from exercise 10 to set the `fill` aesthetic for `geom_density()` to the `client` variable. You should also set `alpha = .5` for transparency and `color=NA` to suppress the outline of the density function.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = round(hour(sdate) + minute(sdate)/60.0, digits = 1)) %>%
  mutate(day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, fill = client)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5, color = NA)+
  facet_wrap(vars(day))
```

  12. Change the previous graph by adding the argument `position = position_stack()` to `geom_density()`. In your opinion, is this better or worse in terms of telling a story? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?

  This graph shows the proportions of each type of rider out of the total. Meaning, the area beneath the graph = 1, where the colors stem from how much out of the total each rider is registered as. This graph does a good job in showing how many riders are registered versus not, but does not a good job of showing its usage and distribution across time. The previous graph is better in showing rider usage throughout the day, and I think this is ultimately the better graph in showing who uses the bike rental service and when.
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = round(hour(sdate) + minute(sdate)/60.0, digits = 1)) %>%
  mutate(day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, fill = client)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5, color = NA, position = position_stack())+
  facet_wrap(vars(day))
```
  
  13. Add a new variable to the dataset called `weekend` which will be "weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday and  "weekday" otherwise (HINT: use the `ifelse()` function and the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Then, update the graph from the previous problem by faceting on the new `weekend` variable. 
  
```{r fig.width= 8, fig.height=6}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = round(hour(sdate) + minute(sdate)/60.0, digits = 1)) %>%
  mutate(day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(weekday = ifelse(day %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), "weekend", "weekday"))  %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, fill = client)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5, color = NA)+
  facet_wrap(vars(weekday))

```
  
  14. Change the graph from the previous problem to facet on `client` and fill with `weekday`. What information does this graph tell you that the previous didn't? Is one graph better than the other?
  This graph tells us that most Casual clients use the bike rental service from midday to late evening no matter the day of the week. Meanwhile, the Registered clients use the bike rental service in the mornings and evenings during the week, and during the midday to late evening during the weekends. I don't necessarily think one graph is better than the other, but is rather more dependent on the question that you are trying to answer (i.e weekend behavior vs. user behavior)
  
```{r fig.width= 8, fig.height=6}
Trips %>%
  mutate(time_of_day = round(hour(sdate) + minute(sdate)/60.0, digits = 1)) %>%
  mutate(day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(weekday = ifelse(day %in% c("Sat", "Sun"), "weekend", "weekday"))  %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = time_of_day, fill = weekday)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5, color = NA)+
  facet_wrap(vars(client))
```
  
### Spatial patterns

  15. Use the latitude and longitude variables in `Stations` to make a visualization of the total number of departures from each station in the `Trips` data. Use either color or size to show the variation in number of departures. We will improve this plot next week when we learn about maps!
  
```{r fig.height= 5}
Trips %>%
  count(sstation) %>%
  rename(name = sstation) %>%
  right_join(Stations, by = "name") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat)) +
  geom_point()
```
  
  16. Only 14.4% of the trips in our data are carried out by casual users. Create a plot that shows which area(s) have stations with a much higher percentage of departures by casual users. What patterns do you notice? (Again, we'll improve this next week when we learn about maps).
  I notice that there are is a higher proportion of Casual riders using services from the middle of the cluster (lat 38.9, long -77.05) to the stations furthest away from this cluster(lat 39.1, long -77.2).
  
```{r fig.height= 5}
Trips %>%
  count(sstation, client) %>%
  rename(name = sstation) %>%
  right_join(Stations, by = "name") %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  mutate(total_prop = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = client,
              values_from = total_prop) %>%
  select(name, lat, long, Casual)  %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, color = Casual)) +
  geom_point()+
  scale_color_continuous(high = "#132B43", low = "#56B1F7")
 
```
  
### Spatiotemporal patterns

  17. Make a table with the ten station-date combinations (e.g., 14th & V St., 2014-10-14) with the highest number of departures, sorted from most departures to fewest. Save this to a new dataset and print out the dataset. Hint: `as_date(sdate)` converts `sdate` from date-time format to date format. 
  
```{r}
Top_Ten_Trips <- Trips %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(sdate)) %>%
  count(sstation, date) %>%
  top_n(10) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
  Top_Ten_Trips
  
```
  
  18. Use a join operation to make a table with only those trips whose departures match those top ten station-date combinations from the previous part.
  
```{r}
Top_Ten_Trips %>%
  left_join(Trips, by = "sstation") 

```
  
  19. Build on the code from the previous problem (ie. copy that code below and then %>% into the next step.) and group the trips by client type and day of the week (use the name, not the number). Find the proportion of trips by day within each client type (ie. the proportions for all 7 days within each client type add up to 1). Display your results so day of week is a column and there is a column for each client type. Interpret your results.
  
  During the weekdays it looks like there is a higher proportion of Registered clients using the bike rental service. During the weekends, the opposite is true. This might indicate that Registered clients may use the biking service to get to/from work, while Casual clients may use the bike service for leisure during the weeks.

```{r}
Top_Ten_Trips %>%
  inner_join(Trips, by = c("sstation")) %>%
  mutate(days = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(days, client) %>%
  summarize(num_clients = n()) %>%
  mutate(total_prop = num_clients/sum(num_clients)) %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = days,
              names_from = client,
              values_from = total_prop)
```

## Challenge problem! 

This problem uses the data from the Tidy Tuesday competition this week, `kids`. If you need to refresh your memory on the data, read about it [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-15/readme.md). 

  21. In this exercise, you are going to try to replicate the graph below, created by Georgios Karamanis. I'm sure you can find the exact code on GitHub somewhere, but **DON'T DO THAT!** You will only be graded for putting an effort into this problem. So, give it a try and see how far you can get without doing too much googling. HINT: use `facet_geo()`. The graphic won't load below since it came from a location on my computer. So, you'll have to reference the original html on the moodle page to see it.
  
  
```{r fig.width=11, fig.height=9}
kids %>%
  filter(variable %in% "lib") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = inf_adj_perchild)) +
  geom_line(color = "white", size =2) +
  theme(legend.position = "") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "lightsteelblue4")) +
  facet_geo(vars(state), grid = "us_state_grid3", label = "name") +
  labs(title="Change in public spending on libraries",
       subtitle = "Dollars spent per child, adjusted for inflation")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size =20, face = "bold"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 15))
  
```
